# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Motors
## llSPS-INT-3361-Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Motors

Predictive maintenance consists of detecting the operation conditions of the motor at full load and under the effective temperature and wetness conditions while working. This is in contrast to regular methods where values are collected by starting the stationary machine.

Industrial environmental conditions have been upgrading day by day with newly developing automation technology. And, as a result of getting rid of the conventional procedures of manufacturing, this leads to an increase in huge workloads. The next-gen industries will be more advanced and automated as compared with existing ones. This brings a new terminology; “Smart Industries”. In this new era, monitoring as well as controlling of various Industrial applications is challenging as ever. The Internet of Things (IoT), as an emerging technology that brought about rapid advancements in modern technologies,  has attracted a lot of attention and is expected to bring benefits to numerous applications. The newly introduced concept is providing a helping hand to achieve Industrial automation through remote access.
In today’s highly competitive business environment, organizations want to increase production and operational efficiency, employee safety and drive financial  results. Many  manufacturing  organizations are  yet to  leverage the  use  of big  data, so that to maintain  production and operational efficiency Industrial motor maintenance plays a key role in its operation. For proper working conditions, the equipment is continuously observed for its temperature, humidity in the environment and any vibration in its operation.so that we can maintain motors properly.

The aim of the project is to monitor any manufacturing plant remotely for temperature, humidity, vibration, current etc. The program will set the parameters and if the results are not within the parameters, it will send a warning so that immediate action can be taken accordingly.
